Rapid includes tools that are configured to work together out of the box. It is designed to be a monorepo that can be used to build full-stack applications.

## Why did I build Rapid?
I was building [Lumoflo](/project/lumoflo) and I realized that I was repeating the same setup for every project. I decided to build a starter that I can use for all my projects. I also wanted to learn more about monorepos and Turbo so I decided to build Rapid. I have been using Rapid for all my projects and it has been a great experience.

## What is different about Rapid?
Rapid includes an end-to-end typesafe API using TS-Rest. It also includes a beautiful UI library called ShadCN/UI. It also includes NextAuth for authentication. It is a full-stack starter that is designed to be a starting point for your next project.

It gives a very similar Developer Experience to a gRPC projects but with the freedom to consume the API from any client. It is designed to be a monorepo that can be used to build full-stack applications. It is designed to be a starting point for your next project.

One can add more apps to the monorepo and they will be automatically built and deployed. It is designed to be a starting point for your next project.
