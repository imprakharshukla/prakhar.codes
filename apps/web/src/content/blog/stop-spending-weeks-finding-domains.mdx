## The Problem

Finding a good domain name is a special kind of hell. You think of a name, type it into GoDaddy, watch the spinner, see "taken", and repeat. Fifty times. Each check takes 5-10 seconds with all the UI loading, and by the end you're questioning every naming decision you've ever made.

I needed a domain for a new SaaS project. I wanted something with "sonar" in it (like the *arr apps - Sonarr, Radarr, etc). Instead of manually checking domains one by one, I used Vercel's domain API with AI agents to check 200+ variations in parallel.

## The Solution: Vercel's Bulk Domain API

Vercel has a simple API endpoint that accepts up to 50 domains at once and returns availability instantly:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.vercel.com/v1/registrar/domains/availability" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "domains": [
      "socialsonar.com",
      "postsonar.com",
      "feedsonar.com",
      "sonarpost.com",
      "contentsonar.com"
    ]
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "results": [
    {"domain": "socialsonar.com", "available": false},
    {"domain": "postsonar.com", "available": true},
    {"domain": "feedsonar.com", "available": false},
    {"domain": "sonarpost.com", "available": false},
    {"domain": "contentsonar.com", "available": true}
  ]
}
```

## Running 10 Agents in Parallel

Here's where it gets fun. I asked Claude Code (Anthropic's AI-powered CLI) to run 10 agents in parallel, each checking a different batch of domain variations:

- Batch 1: Base sonar names (.com)
- Batch 2: Sonarr variations (double r)
- Batch 3: Pulse/radar/ping alternatives
- Batch 4: Scout/probe/scan alternatives
- Batch 5: .app domains
- Batch 6: .io domains
- Batch 7: Prefix variations (get, use, try, hello)
- Batch 8: Alternative TLDs (.social, .co)
- Batch 9: Wave/ripple alternatives
- Batch 10: .dev/.ai/.xyz domains

All 10 batches ran simultaneously. Total time: ~30 seconds for 200+ domains.

## Getting Prices

Once you've got a list of available domains, you'll want to know what they cost. Vercel's price endpoint has you covered:

```bash
curl "https://api.vercel.com/v1/registrar/domains/postsonar.com/price" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

Response:
```json
{
  "years": 1,
  "purchasePrice": 11.25,
  "renewalPrice": 11.25,
  "transferPrice": 11.25
}
```

## Results

From 200+ domains checked, I got back ~30 available options across different TLDs and price points. The results came back organized by availability, making it easy to filter by price or extension preference.

## The API Endpoints

### Check Availability (Bulk)
```
POST https://api.vercel.com/v1/registrar/domains/availability
Body: { "domains": ["domain1.com", "domain2.com", ...] }
Max: 50 domains per request
```

### Check Price
```
GET https://api.vercel.com/v1/registrar/domains/{domain}/price
Returns: purchasePrice, renewalPrice, transferPrice
```

### Get Token
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Settings → Tokens
3. Create new token

### Buy Domain
Found the perfect domain? Skip the checkout UI and buy it directly via API. Payment is charged to the card on file in your Vercel account.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.vercel.com/v1/registrar/domains/mycoolproject.com/buy" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "autoRenew": true,
    "years": 1,
    "expectedPrice": 11.25,
    "contactInformation": {
      "firstName": "Jane",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "email": "jane@example.com",
      "phone": "+1.5551234567",
      "address1": "123 Main St",
      "city": "San Francisco",
      "state": "CA",
      "zip": "94102",
      "country": "US"
    }
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "orderId": "ord_abc123xyz"
}
```

The `expectedPrice` field is a safety check - the purchase fails if the actual price doesn't match, so you won't get surprised by price changes. Pair this with the price check endpoint and you've got a fully automated domain acquisition pipeline.

## Conclusion

Instead of clicking through registrar UIs for 30 minutes, I found the perfect domain in under a minute:

1. Generate 200+ name variations
2. Run parallel API checks with AI agents
3. Filter by availability and price
4. Buy from cheapest registrar

Time saved? About 29 minutes. Sanity preserved? Priceless.
