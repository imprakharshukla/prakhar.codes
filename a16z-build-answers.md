# a16z Build Application - Final Questions

## Why do you want to join a16z Build?

I'm looking for my next early-stage opportunity and want to connect with other builders solving hard problems. I've built products solo (Andronix, Lumoflo) and as founding engineer (Yobr), but want to surround myself with ambitious founders and engineers who are also in the 0→1 phase. a16z Build seems like the right community to find potential co-founders or early-stage teams building something meaningful.

## Timeline - When are you planning/available to start?

Available immediately. Just wrapped up my founding engineer role at Yobr in December 2025.

## What do you hope to give and get from this community?

**Give:**
- Experience building 0→1 products that generate revenue (Andronix: $140K)

- Honest feedback on product ideas and technical decisions

**Get:**
- Connect with potential co-founders or early-stage teams looking for founding engineers

## Anything else that we should know?

I've been building products since high school (Andronix started when I was 15). Most comfortable when I have high ownership and am working on hard technical problems. Recent graduate (5 months out) but proven track record of shipping: $140K revenue, 2.5M+ downloads, founding engineer experience at international startup. Looking for either founding engineer role at exceptional early-stage startup or exploring starting something new with the right co-founder.
