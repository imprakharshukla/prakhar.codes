## Experience & Expectations

### Why are you a good fit?

I'm a founding engineer with a track record of shipping products at scale. At Yobr (Norway), I built the entire backend from scratch using Next.js, Fastify, and tRPC, and architected AI agents with 100+ tools orchestrating multi-party workflows. I've also built Andronix to $140K revenue (2.5M+ downloads, #1 on Google Play for "Linux") and Lumoflo - a multi-tenant e-commerce SaaS processing $1.5M+ in transactions.

I thrive in 0-to-1 environments. At Lumoflo, I reduced build times by 56% and optimized dev server startup from 5.12 minutes to under 10 seconds. I'm obsessed with type safety (tRPC, ts-rest across all projects), move fast without breaking things (wrote 40+ e2e tests), and care deeply about infrastructure that actually works at scale. I ship fast, take ownership, and don't need hand-holding.

### Why are you potentially not a good fit?

I'm early in my career (graduated in 2025), so I don't have experience managing teams or making high-level strategic decisions that come with 5-10 years of experience. I'm also strongest in backend/infrastructure work and AI integration - if the role requires heavy frontend design work or deep domain expertise in areas I haven't touched (like embedded systems or hardware), there would be a learning curve.

I work best with clear ownership and autonomy. If the role requires a lot of process, meetings, or working within rigid structures, I might not be the best fit. I thrive when given a problem and trusted to figure out the solution.

### What is your expected rate?

SGD 6,000 - 8,000 per month (SGD 72,000 - 96,000 per year)

I'm flexible based on the role, equity component, and growth opportunities. Happy to discuss.

### What is your desired start date?

I'm available immediately and can start as soon as visa processing is complete. If relocation is required, I'd need 2-3 weeks to arrange logistics after visa approval. No notice period - Yobr shut down in December 2025.

## Relocation & Visa Requirements

### Where do you plan to work from?

**Selected:** I am fine with either working remotely or relocating to Singapore.

**Preference:** I'm open to relocating to Singapore if that's preferred by the company. I'm also comfortable working remotely from India if that works better initially. Flexible on this.

### Do you need visa sponsorship to work in Singapore?

**Selected:** Yes, I will require visa sponsorship to work in Singapore.

**Note:** I'm an Indian citizen and would need an Employment Pass (EP) or similar work visa if relocating to Singapore.

### You are a...

**Selected:** Neither

(Not a Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident)

- Wellfound (AngelList)

- Other: [specify]

### Anything else you'd like us to know?

I'm actively exploring opportunities in Singapore's tech ecosystem. I've worked remotely with international teams (Yobr was based in Norway, Casecraft in Singapore), so I'm comfortable with distributed work environments and async communication.

I'm looking for high-growth startups where I can have significant impact early on. I care less about title and more about working on hard problems with smart people. If there's an opportunity to work on AI, infrastructure, or developer tools, I'm especially interested.

Available for interviews on short notice and can accommodate Singapore timezone for calls.

## Notes

- Converts to roughly USD 4,500-6,000/month (at ~1.35 SGD:USD)

- Shows adaptability
