Hey {company} team,

I've been building AI-powered products recently. At Yobr (Norway), I worked as a founding engineer on AI agents and async workflows. At Casecraft, I built production AI pipelines using OpenAI for med-AI pre-doctor training platforms.

Before that, I built Andronix to $140K revenue (2.5M+ downloads) and Lumoflo (e-commerce SaaS with payment orchestration). I'm comfortable building 0→1 products across the stack.

Looking for early-stage founding engineer role where I can work on hard technical problems. Would love to chat about what you're building and explore if there's a fit.

Best,
Prakhar

Hi {name},

I saw your posting for the {role_title} - this seems like an excellent match for my background.

I just wrapped up a founding engineer role at Yobr (Norway) where I:
• Built AI agent systems with 100+ custom tools using Vercel AI SDK and Mastra.ai
• Designed complex async workflows with Trigger.dev for multi-step orchestration
• Architected full-stack platform with TypeScript, React, PostgreSQL, and tRPC
• Shipped production LLM-powered features with streaming and stateful workflows

Before that, I built Andronix to $140K revenue (2.5M+ downloads) and Lumoflo (e-commerce SaaS), so I'm comfortable with founding team dynamics and building 0→1 products.

{Specific reason this role matches - tech stack, domain, etc.}

I'm based in India and prefer remote work, but I'm open to relocating if the role requires it. Would love to discuss this opportunity further.

Happy to share more details or hop on a call.
