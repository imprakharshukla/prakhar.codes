# Introduction Paragraphs

## Version 1: Full Background (Standard)

I'm Prakhar Shukla, a full-stack engineer who builds products people actually use and pay for. I built Andronix to $140K revenue with 2.5M+ downloads (started in high school), then most recently worked as founding engineer at Yobr in Norway building AI agents and full-stack platform with Next.js/Fastify. I've also built Lumoflo, a multi-tenant e-commerce SaaS handling payment orchestration and inventory automation. I'm looking for early-stage founding engineer roles where I can own features end-to-end and work on hard technical problems.

## Version 2: Revenue-First (For Business-Focused Roles)

I'm Prakhar, a founding engineer who's built $140K in revenue through Andronix (2.5M+ downloads). Most recently, I was founding engineer at Yobr (Norway) where I built AI agent systems and led full-stack development. I've shipped products solo (Andronix, Lumoflo) and on small teams (Yobr, Casecraft), always focused on 0→1 building and getting products to market fast. Looking for early-stage roles where I can have outsized impact.

## Version 3: Technical-First (For Engineering-Heavy Roles)

I'm Prakhar, a full-stack engineer specializing in TypeScript/React/Node.js and AI/ML integrations. I was founding engineer at Yobr (Norway) building AI agents with 100+ tools, complex async workflows, and production LLM applications. Before that, I built Andronix (2.5M+ downloads, $140K revenue) solo and Lumoflo (e-commerce SaaS with payment orchestration). I thrive in early-stage environments with high ownership and technical complexity.

## Version 4: AI/ML Focused

I'm Prakhar, a founding engineer with deep experience building production AI systems. At Yobr (Norway), I architected AI agent platforms with 100+ custom tools using Vercel AI SDK and Mastra.ai. At Casecraft, I built AI pipelines for medical education. I've also built revenue-generating products (Andronix: $140K, 2.5M+ downloads) and complex SaaS platforms (Lumoflo). Looking for roles where I can build AI products that actually work reliably in production, not just impressive demos.

## Version 5: Shortest (Twitter Bio / Quick Intro)

Founding engineer. Built Andronix to $140K revenue (2.5M+ downloads). Most recently at Yobr (Norway) building AI agents and full-stack platform. Looking for early-stage roles.

---

## Version 6: For Founders/CEOs

I'm Prakhar, a builder who's proven I can go from 0→1. Built Andronix to $140K revenue completely solo, then joined Yobr (Norway) as founding engineer where I owned AI architecture and full-stack development. I care about shipping fast, owning outcomes, and building products people love. Looking to join early-stage teams where I can have founding-level impact.

---

## Version 7: Recent Graduate Angle (If Needed)

I'm Prakhar, a recent CS graduate (5 months out) who's been building products for years. Started Andronix in high school and grew it to $140K revenue with 2.5M+ downloads. After graduating, joined Yobr (Norway) as founding engineer building AI agents and full-stack platform. Also built Lumoflo (e-commerce SaaS) and worked at Casecraft on med-AI. Looking for early-stage founding engineer roles where experience shipping matters more than years on a resume.
